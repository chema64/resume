    <li><b>September 2009 to March 2016 YearOne Software
    </b>
    <ul>
        <li>At YearOne Software my primary role was a Software Tester. While carrying out this role I was responsible for carrying out black-box-dynamic testing for acceptance, confirmation and regression testing duties. As the development environment was agile in nature, exploratory testing would be carried out. The level of documentation dictated how much exploratory testing was required to reach exit criteria. If more information was required for code coverage, developers responsible for the case as well as test managers were consulted. Documentation and test plans were provided from Fogbugz case test plans and Instant Demo review videos. 
            
            To carry out this testing I would setup test environments using all Microsoft Operating Systems ranging from Windows XP to Windows Server 2012. Using the work MSDN account, I would download different Microsoft Operating Systems and Microsoft Office products required for test environments. This was made possible by XenCenter, which was used to create virtual machines. I carried out manual Smoke Tests twice a week. Automated test script created by developers was also used for bi-weekly Smoke Tests.  Each morning before other workers arrive I had the responsibility of upgrading the administrations-live data server each morning, to latest version of software. 
            
            Testing jobs were managed using a web-based system called Fogbugz. I use Fogbugz to create new cases when new incidents or failures are discovered. Fogbugz was also used for exit criteria verification. Once exit criteria for a case had been achieved, any testware or pertinent logs creating during testing are archived with case notes for verification. Manual test script was created using Microsoft Excel. Templates for new cases were created first in Microsoft Word. Any incident or failure discovered was recorded as a video using a program called Instant Demo, before being added to case notes with any required testware for verification.
            
            Communication between developers and myself was required on a daily basis. The communication involves face-to-face conversations, Skype conversions and email. Skype and face-to-face conversations were the most common due also to the fact that I work with remote workers in Sydney, Brisbane and sometimes Townsville. While administration is away I was also given the role of talking to customers to gather information about support problems. I also carried out Level 2 support for software installations, which involved remotely logging on to a site using Logmein123, while talking to the customer with a headset. 
            
            A large difficulty range exists for test cases.  For example, some cases can be very basic requiring just the verification that controls displayed the correct text or icon, whereas other cases require validation and verification of the following areas:
            <br />
            <br />
            <ol>
                <li>The correct output and functionality of custom-built functions and events within the software.</li>
                <li>The correct functionality related to database create, update and delete operations
                </li>
                <li>The correct double entry accounting business logic in context of the tables being populated and calculations being performed as expected.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br />
            Infrequently, in the past I was given the responsibility of upgrading the ram, hard drives and video cards on different work computers. When required, I would also setup up new workstations to the works internetwork for new employees. I would also contact Dell support to troubleshoot problems occurring with XenServers.

<li><b>October 2016 to present Aozhongqiao
</b>
<ul>
    <li>I created a static responsive website (<a href="https://www.aozhongqiao.com/">https://www.aozhongqiao.com/</a>) to profile the iNQ Startup company Aozhongqiao (owned by Tanya Barlow). The responsive website was created using HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap 3.3.7. This site had to cater for both Chinese and English clients, so duel language sites were created using Hreflang (link Canonical and all Alternate "en" and "zh-hans" languages). I handled all ICT required to update and optimize this static website. Optimization was performed using the Gulp libraries available for Nodejs. Optimization was also carried out following recommendations from Google Search Console. I also created a Facebook page for the Aozhongqiao business. I also setup a new efficient workflow for Tanya using Cloud resources such as Google Drive and Gmail. Lastly, I created a Visual Basic Application for Tanya that allowed her to save any word document in two separate places every time a save function was performed. The website was then hosted using Hosting Australia

<li><b>April 2016 to August 2020 Alliance Francaise de Townsville </b>
    <ul>
        <li>On April 2016, I gave ICT recommendations on how to best proceed with the creation of a new website for Alliance Francaise de Townsville. Starting on February 2017 I was given the responsibility of performing updates on the groups WordPress website ( http://www.aftownsville.org.au/ ). Content changes were applied using HTML5 and CSS3 via the WordPress CMS. Images were optimized using Nodejs Gulp library. Where required WordPress Plugins were used for new responsive content. I also performed administrative duties such as creating Mailchimp email campaigns, updating Mailchimp contacts, forwarded emails to required members and setup email signatures using Gmail.

<li><b>July 2017 to September 2017	 Nourishing Bites </b>

<li><b>October 2017 to September 2018	 James Cook University </b>
    <ul>
        <li>While working at JCU I have worked in both the Digital Marketing department and the eResearch department. While working at Digital Marketing I was responsible for the migration of the current intranet JCU Web Framework from using Bootstrap 3 to using Bootstrap version 4. While working for eResearch my duties varied quite a bit. For my first tasks I gathered and then created website content for an internal website using universities content management system (Squiz Matrix CMS). The next task I carried out, involved me reviewing various panorama programmes to find which was appropriate for a local project. After which I then used that software to create a panorama for the project. The next task I was responsible for was video editing a large number of researcher videos from the same project. Lastly, I was responsible for reviewing various audit checklist software, each of which collected data using a mobile app, to find out which would be most appropriate for another local project. My responsibility after that was to then create tests audits using requirements from the project to test the functionality of each piece of audit software.
